# Description

This contains the code and files for my personal website ([jdleongomez.info](https://jdleongomez.info/)), created using the [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) website builder for Hugo. If you are interested, you can check the [Academic Kickstart](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/), or clone my [personal website repository](https://github.com/JDLeongomez/JDLeongomez).

This website is nothing new, but it is a working multilingual example ([English](https://jdleongomez.info/) and [Spanish](https://jdleongomez.info/es/)). Latest deploy status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2cc2692d-c569-4d77-b283-a8526e655ea4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jdleongomez/deploys).
