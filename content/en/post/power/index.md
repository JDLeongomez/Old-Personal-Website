In this series, I explain the basics of **power analysis** and how to use it to calculate the **sample size** needed for a study.

The videos focus on the procedure to perform **power analysis** and **sample size** calculation in [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) and particularly in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), using the packages [`pwr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pwr/) (for simple designs) and [`Superpower`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Superpower/vignettes/intro_to_superpower.html) (for more complex factorial designs). The section dedicated to [`pwr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pwr/) is largely based on [this video](https://youtu.be/ZIjOG8LTTh8) by Daniel S. Quintana (2019).

This series, is also supported by a written practical guide:
