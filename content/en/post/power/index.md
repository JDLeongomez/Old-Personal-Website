In this series, I explain the basics of power analysis and how to use it to calculate the sample size needed for a study.

The videos focus on the procedure to perform power analysis and sample size calculation in jamovi and particularly in R, using the packages [pwr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pwr/) (for simple designs) and [Superpower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Superpower/vignettes/intro_to_superpower.html) (for more complex factorial designs). The section dedicated to [pwr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pwr/) is largely based on [this video](https://youtu.be/ZIjOG8LTTh8) by Daniel S. Quintana (2019).
